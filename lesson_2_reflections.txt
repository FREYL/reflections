What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a new git repositories where I will be able to control versions. Nevertheless it does not have one commit yet. I could find out with the command git log and git status. First I wanted to use git diff but this is only used to track changes between different commits. When running git status, it shows clearly that there was no commit when running the command git init.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is in a meta layer, so that it is not yet in the repository but further than the working directory. This means, that we can check what we want to commit before we commit it to the repository finally.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area allows to see what files or directories have been changed and will be committed. If there are too many, one can still remove some files. If there are too little one can still add files.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If you are creating a new version, experimenting, languages.
