When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I am working from different location as well as if there are multiple users that need acess to the files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might be changing something locally and you want to define at what point of time the repositories should be synced.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

fork copies a repository on github to my account. Clone copies a repository either locally or from github to local. Branch does not copy but creates a new version in the same repository.
Fork: If you want to copy somebody's repository to your own account on git hub quickly with letting him get credit for it
Clone: If I want to have a repository quickly locally and we want to work on the same repository
Branch: If I want to test something without changing the original masters version.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Because then you prevent merging conflicts

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Probably with a dropbox file. It would be easier because all the complicated commands would not need to be learned. It would be more complicated because it creates conflicts that are not easily solvable as in git and git hub.
