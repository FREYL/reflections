When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If I am working from different location as well as if there are multiple users that need acess to the files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might be changing something locally and you want to define at what point of time the repositories should be synced.
